### Learn how to design large-scale systems

Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic.  There is a **vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web** on system design principles.

This repo is an **organized collection** of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

### Learn from the open source community

This is a continually updated, open source project.

[Contributions](#contributing) are welcome!

### Prep for the system design interview

In addition to coding interviews, system design is a **required component** of the **technical interview process** at many tech companies.

**Practice common system design interview questions** and **compare** your results with **sample solutions**: discussions, code, and diagrams.

Additional topics for interview prep:

* [Study guide](#study-guide)
* [How to approach a system design interview question](#how-to-approach-a-system-design-interview-question)
* [System design interview questions, **with solutions**](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
* [Object-oriented design interview questions, **with solutions**](#object-oriented-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
* [Additional system design interview questions](#additional-system-design-interview-questions)

## Index of system design topics

> Summaries of various system design topics, including pros and cons.  **Everything is a trade-off**.
>
> Each section contains links to more in-depth resources.

## System design topics: start here

New to system design?

First, you'll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

[Scalability](http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono)

* Topics covered:
    * [Clones](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we'll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.
